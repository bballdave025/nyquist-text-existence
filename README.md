This repository explores the limits of **text existence detection** in digitized manuscript imagery under fundamental sampling constraints.

The central claim is that many failures to detect faint, peripheral, or low–pixel-footprint writing are not due to model choice or training data, but to irreversible information loss caused by resolution, bit-depth, or compression decisions made upstream.

The work distinguishes:
- text existence vs. text recognition,
- model uncertainty vs. information-theoretic absence,
- and recoverable vs. unrecoverable historical signal.

The repository contains:
- vision and scope documents,
- technical notes (including Nyquist-based arguments),
- experimental design scaffolding,
- and thematic examples linking theory to manuscript reuse contexts.
