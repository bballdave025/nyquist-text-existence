## What OSF Preregistration Is (and Why We Use It)

This project uses preregistration via the **Open Science Framework (OSF)**  
(https://osf.io/), a nonprofit, open infrastructure operated by the
**Center for Open Science**.

OSF preregistration provides a **timestamped, immutable record** of research
questions, hypotheses, and analysis plans *before confirmatory analysis begins*.
It is not a journal, a reviewer, or a gatekeeper. Its sole purpose is to make
explicit what was claimed in advance and to distinguish confirmatory work from
exploratory work.

In this project, preregistration serves three goals:

1. **Clarifying epistemic boundaries**  
   We explicitly distinguish between:
   - theory development,
   - exploratory analysis,
   - and confirmatory testing.

2. **Preventing hindsight bias and claim-switching**  
   By stating hypotheses and falsification conditions in advance, we reduce the
   risk of unintentionally adapting claims to observed outcomes.

3. **Supporting negative and boundary-setting results**  
   This work focuses on information-theoretic limits (e.g., Nyquist constraints),
   where null or negative results are often the most informative outcomes.

### Confirmatory vs. Exploratory Work

In this project, we adopt the following rule:

> **Confirmatory analysis begins at the first execution of a pre-registered test
> on the locked image set and locked resampling procedure.**

All work prior to that point—including theory development, synthetic examples,
visual inspection, and feasibility exploration—is considered exploratory and is
explicitly labeled as such.

### Flexibility and Addenda

OSF preregistration does **not** prohibit learning, iteration, or refinement.
Instead, it requires that:
- preregistered documents are not retroactively edited, and
- any changes or extensions are recorded as **addenda**, preserving the original
  claims and timestamps.

This approach supports rigor without freezing the research process.

### Relationship to Publication

OSF preregistration:
- does **not** delay or prevent arXiv preprints,
- does **not** imply peer review,
- and does **not** constrain later exploratory analyses.

It simply provides a stable reference point for what was claimed *before*
confirmatory tests were run.
