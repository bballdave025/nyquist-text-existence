This directory and its documents are meant to provide a place to think through
the general and specific hypotheses we want to test with this study, to clearly
explain these hypotheses and how they can be falsified, and to prepare this
preregistration for submission (to OSF or a similar place that collects such 
preregistrations.)

It is expected that our ideas of

- what can be tested,
- how it can be tested,
- why we want to preregister,
- what we want to preregister,
- and specific conditions for falsification

will evolve as we look at the theory and do some exploratory analysis. 

It is also expected that the authors will learn a lot about the process and
ideas of preregistration and will want to share this information as well as
their new understanding in documents here in this directory.
