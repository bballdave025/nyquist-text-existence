# I Dare You, Keith
Hey Keith. This is a conversational artifact of our collaboration. you might want to go look at the images in `draft_figures/`, read `thematic_image_info.md` and hopefully be able to tie the images to the document. If you can't, because items not clear as mud, you should still take up this challenge. (By the way, if you want more details in a less-coherent package, go to the section after the challenge and four horizontal separators called _Idea Tracking_.
